It works as a dash if you want to get in position for an anti-air Shoryuken or simply get face-to-face to the enemy and throw before he reacts. A main advantage of using this move instead of walking while exchanging projectiles is that you can use a Hadouken as soon as you recover, while walking forward and attempting a Hadouken immediately will give you a Shoryuken instead due to command overlapping. It can also be used to punish enemies from close range, as it gives you enough time to link most your normals after it. For example, standing Fierce or crouching Forward into red Hadouken."

It can be used for jumping on you opponent after a knockdown and not generate much push-back, allowing you to apply mix-ups such as throw, cr.forward xx Hadouken/super or delayed Jab SRK (to beat reversal throws). This beats Zangief's Lariats from the right distance and still hits him if he crouches."

If you successfully land this attack in the air, you may use it again until you obtain three aerial hits. This can be considered as anti-air, specially if you react early and you believe the opponent will try a late aerial attack. A super can also be comboed after this move, for a total of 5 hits. From the right distance, this move beats Lariats and Blanka's rolling attacks. However, any grounded enemy can avoid the attack by crouching, which is specially dangerous against Zangief, E. Honda and Hawk, as they can throw while crouching (stomach press, Oiicho and typhoon, in this order)."

The strength of the punch determines its speed and damage: Jab flies the slowest and does less damage, while Fierce flies the fastest and does more damage. Fierce only does more damage than Strong if it hits during the first 26 active frames though (from point-blank range to mid screen). Although all 3 versions (Jab, Strong, Fierce) have Ryu release the fireball at the same interval, Ryu will recover from the vulnerable 'after-throw' state fastest after a Jab fireball and slowest after a Fierce fireball. However, the difference is almost imperceptible. You can reduce the recovery of strong and Fierce Hadoukens by kara or special canceling a jab or short into them. Conversely, all versions will have the longest recovery when canceled out of a Fierce or Roundhouse. Some characters such as Vega can punish Hadoukens on block or hit from close distance, so watch out for that. In addition to it, the move can evade completely when used from point-blank range, as some characters' attacks move their hitboxes towards a bit. This leaves Ryu wide open for throws or any ground combo they want to use.This move is known to do high amounts of stun damage. Three hits in a row and pretty much any enemy falls dizzy."
